# 06-HW-weatherDashboard
- Check the local weather of any city!

[Live site!](https://mmonyok.github.io/06-HW-weatherDashboard/)

## Description
- Understanding server-side APIs is an important part of my coding journey. Working with them on this project will go a long way in assisting me in developing my coding skills and knowledge. 
- The changing weather and its patterns are an integral part of daily life for everyone. Knowing the current and future weather will help anyone make or change plans, depending on how the weather affects them. This webpage allows for one to check the current weather, as well as the weather for the next 5 days.
- This project helped me better solidy my JavaScript knowledge, especially as switched to working predominantly in jQuery. I also learned a lot more about navigating server-side APIs, changing their parameters, and finding how to best manipulate them for my needs.
